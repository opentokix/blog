# Sysadmin life style 

### Start using computers

When I was 13 years old I had my first real encounter with unsupervised computer usage. It was incredible, I had no idea what I was doing and it was the best time of life so far. Everyday since then I have had the same feeling, everyday at work and everyday at home. The feeling of full control, and endless possibilites. 

### Knowledge 

Information around computers and computer usage has always come very easy to me. Since is the number one thing I really enjoy doing even now 26 years later. I read anything I can get my hands on, listen to podcasts related to my field, or about things I hate. I want to know, I want to grasp something about everything. Knowledge is power! And you need power to be root. 

### Technology

The most important aspects of beeing a great sysadmin is to keep current. Maybe not use everything, but to keep an eye of what is happening in your field. Sometimes it will change your mind on a tech, and sometimes (most of the time) it will give you the information you need to say no! 

### Monitoring and metrics 

I obsess over my monitoring, I want to know why every single error and warning occurs. I want to know if it is needed, is this treshold the correct one, should I make it tighter or looser. I want my monitoring to be perfect. 

When it comes to metrics, they are great for troubleshooting, but what is even more important is to keep track on what your systems look like when they are running normal. If you dont know what is normal, you have no way of knowing what your troubleshooting should lead to and where to start. 

### Can everybody become a sysadmin

I do not think so. Every good and great sysadmin I have ever meet seem to be a certain obsessive type of person. Very detail oriented, and tend to be quite excentric. This is of course only my personal observations.
