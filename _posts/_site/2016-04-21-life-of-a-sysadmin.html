<p>When I was 13 years old I had my first real encounter with unsupervised computer usage. It was incredible, I had no idea what I was doing and it was the best time of life so far. Everyday since then I have had the same feeling, everyday at work and everyday at home. The feeling of full control, and endless possibilites. </p>

<p>Information around computers and computer usage has always come very easy to me. Since is the number one thing I really enjoy doing even now 26 years later. I read anything I can get my hands on, listen to podcasts related to my field, or about things I hate. I want to know, I want to grasp something about everything. Knowledge is power! And you need power to be root. </p>
